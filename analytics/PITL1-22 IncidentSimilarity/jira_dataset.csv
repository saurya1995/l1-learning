For example, if a developer only makes small changes in a file, he most likely is not implementing a new feature but doing maintenance work. The goal is figuring out which files a developer is most familiar with to estimate if this developer would be a good choice for tasks regarding a file. This metric could also be used as basis for other metrics, for example if large changes are estimated in a file with a comparatively low amount of lines, this could suggest a problem (file requiring a rewrite for each change)

While a simple version of this could be achieved with statistical approach, using machine learning will enable the usage of multiple inputs that change the estimated entropy.",,ga65hif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ghx-label-1,,Estimate commit entropy,To Do,"0|i003qv:",,,,,,

The developer tries to find older similar incidents which have been solved because most of the time bugs are in that area of code base.

Build a system which will try to find similar related incidents/bugs. I guess this can be achieved by applying NLP models of  text similarity.

Future scope: We can extend it for finding any related discussions that have taken place related to those solved incidents in Slack.
