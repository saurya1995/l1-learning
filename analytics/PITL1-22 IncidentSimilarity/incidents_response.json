The developer tries to find older similar incidents which have been solved because most of the time bugs are in that area of code base.\r\n\r\nBuild a system which will try to find similar related incidents/bugs. I guess this can be achieved by applying NLP models of\u00a0 text similarity.\r\n\r\nFuture scope: We can extend it for finding any related discussions that have taken place related to those solved incidents in Slack.\r\n\r\n\u00a0"}, {"issue_id": "11146", "issue_key": "PITL1-16", "assignee": "nikanmog", "similarity_score": "0.4573", "reporter": "saurypande", "summary": "Make use of ML and analyze an individual performance", "description": "Make use of available data from Github, Slack, Confluence and Jira and evaluate individual performance using ML and NLP.\u00a0 Parameters which we can use:\r\n # Number of incidents/Bugs/Stories assigned to the person.\r\n # Average time taken by the individual to complete those incidents.\r\n # How active a person is on tools like slack, github, jira.\r\n # Number of code reviews done by the person.\r\n # Number of meetings the person is part off.\r\n # Number of lines of code written by the individual.\r\n # Number of documentation the person is part off."}, {"issue_id": "11111", "issue_key": "PITL1-12", "assignee": "ga65hif", "similarity_score": "0.3243", "reporter": "nikanmog", "summary": "Jira - Detect which task take very long and potentially hold up other tasks and project progress", "description": "Jira data\r\n\r\nML Model, anomaly detection"}]
