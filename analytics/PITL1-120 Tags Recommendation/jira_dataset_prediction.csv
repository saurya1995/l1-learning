The developer tries to find older similar incidents which have been solved because most of the time bugs are in that area of code base.

Build a system which will try to find similar related incidents/bugs. I guess this can be achieved by applying NLP models of  text similarity.

Future scope: We can extend it for finding any related discussions that have taken place related to those solved incidents in Slack.
